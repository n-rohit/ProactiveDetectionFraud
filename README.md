# ProactiveDetectionFraud
This code is useful for the Proactive Detection of Fraudulent Transactions. Here, I have used <b>sklearn</b> or <b>Scikit-Learn</b> module for designing 2 models using <b>Isolation Forest classifier</b>(Unsupervised Algorithm) and <b>Random Forest classifier</b>(Supervised Algorithm)

Firstly I used the Data Cleaning Techniques to prepare and organize the data. Then I used the prepared data to train the models. Finally, I evaluated the models to get an optimum accuracy of 99.99 percent. I have provided a detailed description of all the concepts covered and code executed in the given <b>Proactive_Detection_Fraud.ipynb</b> file.
