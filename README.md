# ProactiveDetectionFraud
This code is useful for the Proactive Detection of Fraudulent Transactions. Here, I have used <b>sklearn</b> or <b>Scikit-Learn</b> module for designing a <b>Random Forest classifier</b> model

Firstly I used the Data Cleaning Techniques to prepare and organize the data. Then I used the prepared data to train the model. Finally, I evaluated the module to get an optimum accuracy of 99.99 percent.
